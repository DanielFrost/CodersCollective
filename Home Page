		<!--What is it that I  need in this section?  This is the  home  page.  Shoudl I have a  home page  video?  Answer: Yes,  yes I should.

		However I  need to  have more than A video. Most of it  will  be  about displaying the  GUI in a  user friendly  way with beautiful color
		or at least  stylized. I think that the  home page should have information about us, therefore there is no  need for an about  page. 
		Well I  Suppose this is enough for  one day... -->
